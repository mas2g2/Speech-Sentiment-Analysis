Name of my program: Speech Sentiment Analysis Version 1.0

This program analyzes a user's sentiment based on what they said. To check if this file works run the command "node get-speech-data.js --name-of-audio-file--" or "python sa_test.py --name-of-audio-file--" to recieve sentiment analysis data. After you run these commands you will receive information that will let you know about the users sentiment in the audio file. The functions for sentiment analysis are found in the python file sentiment_analysis.py. This contains a pre-trained module which can be retrained by  going to line 37 of file sentiment_analysis.py and changing the value of the variable trsined from True to Falsee.
